# WearTube

My in-dev YouTube client for Wear OS 4 (Android Smartwatch), lets you search and watch YouTube videos and livestreams.

Was planning to release as early access on the Play Store but Google now requires at least 20 testers before Play Store release for new developers and Wear OS (Android Smartwatch) app is hard to find that many as a small developer.
